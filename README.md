[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/SELab-2/OSOC-2/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=CU687M8DPV)](https://codecov.io/gh/SELab-2/OSOC-2)

## How to contribute

This repository is a monorepo, meaning that both frontend and backend share the same github repository.

Both frontend and backend can be treated as seperate projects. However, if you wish to commit a change you will first need to run `npm install`. The root folder is configured in a way to automatically make some checks on your code and commit messages and needs some dependencies.

### Conventional commits

You need to use conventional commits, or else PR's will fail. For more information see https://github.com/SELab-2/OSOC-2/issues/9
