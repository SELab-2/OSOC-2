# Software Engineering Lab 2 - 2021-2022: Team 2

## Introduction 
This repo is the osoc selection solution team 2 made for [Open Knowledge Belgium](https://openknowledge.be/).
In order to create a selection tool, we created an [online platform](https://sel2-2.ugent.be/login) where coaches can assign students to projects.
<br/>The tool is made with a variety of technologies, the main ones being PostGres, Prsima.js, Next.js and Express.js.
<br/>An extensive list of all the documentations can be found [here](https://selab-2.github.io/OSOC-2/).
