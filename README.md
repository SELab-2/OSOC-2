# OSOC-2

## How to contribute

This repository is a monorepo, meaning that both frontend and backend share the same github repository.

Both frontend and backend can be treated as seperate projects. However, if you wish to commit a change you will first need to run `npm install`. The root folder is configured in a way to automatically make some checks on your code and commit messages and needs some dependencies.
